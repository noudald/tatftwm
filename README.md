# Tips and Tricks for the Working Mathematician

Richard Feynman was known for being one of the most clever physists out there.
If you had a mathematics problem you could not solve, you would go to Feynman
and he would solve it for you.  Actually, he knew that if you go to him for
help you already tried all the common methods.  He would not try the common
methods, instead he would immediately apply his special "bag of tricks", as
these special tricks would not have been used before to solve the problem.

The idea of the repository is to be a collection of special "bag of tricks"
that can be used to solve mathematical problems.
